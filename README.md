# Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM): Exploring the Spectrum

In a recent exploration, I delved deep into the intricate world of Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM). This technique stands out for its unique ability to divide the frequency spectrum among multiple streams of information. This project highlighted the potential of FDM in real-world scenarios, particularly its capability to enhance data transmission rates and allow multiple transmissions within the same frequency domain.

## Overview:

### 1. Algorithms and Techniques:

- **Convolutional Encoding**: Leveraging convolutional encoding, I fortified the integrity of transmissions. This technique adds redundancy to the message through specific XOR operations, which significantly aids in error detection and correction.

- **On-off Keying Modulation**: I employed the On-off Keying technique for signal modulation. This method modulates the amplitude of the carrier wave based on the binary values of the message.

- **Bandpass Filtering**: I implemented a bandpass filter to hone in on the desired frequency range, ensuring clear and focused transmissions.

### 2. Technologies and Libraries:

- Used `numpy` for robust numerical computations and signal processing.
- Integrated `scipy.fft` for efficient Fourier transformations.
- Employed `sounddevice` for seamless audio signal interfacing.

### 3. Insights:

- This exploration deepened my understanding of the utility of different frequency bands for distinct transmissions.
- Navigating the complexities of frequency multiplexing was enlightening, especially when aiming to optimize system data rates.
- The project emphasized the profound potential of FDM, especially when considering multiple systems transmitting within shared frequency spaces.

In summary, this exploration was a blend of foundational knowledge and practical application. The nuances of FDM and its potential applications offered valuable insights, paving the way for further explorations in the realm of communication systems.
