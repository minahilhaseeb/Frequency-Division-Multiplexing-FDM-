## Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM): An Implementation Guide

### 1. **Setup**:
- **Library Initialization**: Start by integrating fundamental libraries like `numpy` for mathematical operations, `scipy.fft` for Fourier transformations, and `sounddevice` for managing audio signals.

### 2. **Convolutional Encoding**:
- Convert the target binary message for transmission.
- Apply XOR operations for message encoding. This method extends the message's length, injecting redundancy which bolsters the message's reliability, facilitating error detection and rectification during reception.

### 3. **On-off Keying Modulation**:
- Utilize On-off Keying for signal modulation post-encoding.
- Adjust the amplitude of a carrier signal based on the binary values of the encoded content. This modulation simplifies the demodulation process during reception.

### 4. **Signal Aggregation for Transmission**:
- Ready the modulated signal for dispatch.
- For concurrent message transmissions (a hallmark of FDM), merge multiple modulated outputs.

### 5. **Bandpass Filtration**:
- During reception, it's vital to sieve out undesired frequencies to maintain signal clarity.
- Implement a bandpass filter, retaining frequencies within a designated range and eliminating all others. This process ensures a clear reception and minimizes potential disruptions from unrelated frequencies.

### 6. **Decoding & Signal Restoration**:
- Post filtration, demodulate the signal to extract the binary encoded content.
- Use convolutional decoding to revert the encoded content to its original form, leveraging the redundancy added during encoding for error checks and corrections.

### 7. **Output Generation**:
- Post successful decoding, retrieve the original binary content, which can then be transformed to its desired format, such as text or another data type.

### 8. **System Reliability Checks**:
- Ensure the system's efficacy through rigorous testing, which includes dispatching data via real-world channels like speakers and verifying the accuracy of the received content.

By following this framework, this implementation facilitates efficient data transfers using Frequency-Division Multiplexing, enabling simultaneous data dispatches sans interference.
